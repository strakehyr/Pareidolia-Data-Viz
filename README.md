# Pareidolia // Data Viz

Pareidolia is a utility for parsing, merging, and visualizing time-series data from CSV files. It is built to handle common data cleaning tasks like delimiter detection, decimal separator differences, and irregular timestamp formats.

## Features

- **Ingestion**: Automated detection of delimiters and decimal formats.
- **Cleaning**: Skip specific rows or columns. Handles "unit rows" automatically.
- **Merging**: Combine multiple files by column name or index. 
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts with multi-axis support and time-series aggregation.
- **AI Insights**: Brief summaries and trend analysis via Gemini.

## Usage

1. **Upload**: Drop CSV files into the data source tab.
2. **Configure**: Adjust parsing settings or rename columns if files need to be merged.
3. **Visualize**: Select the time column and add data series to the plot.
4. **Export**: Download the processed and combined dataset as a clean CSV.

## Design

The application uses a retro-modern aesthetic with high contrast and sharp geometry.
